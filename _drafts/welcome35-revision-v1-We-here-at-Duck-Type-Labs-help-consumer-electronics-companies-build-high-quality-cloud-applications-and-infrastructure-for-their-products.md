With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), products once isolated from each other and the world at large have attained the ability to talk. Working with us, you can expect expert guidance in navigating the cloud application space and building a _brain_ for your products that enables them to be full fledged citizens in a connected world.

Giving your products a brain via cloud computing greatly increases their ability to make decisions taking into account as many relevant factors as possible. Take the smart sprinkler controller market and the Rachio Iro as an example. The Iro, via a highly sophisticated cloud application, obtains data from multiple weather stations to calculate the optimal irrigation schedule for the user&#8217;s outdoor landscape.

We&#8217;d love to hear from you! Let us know what you&#8217;d like to learn about when it comes to building products for the Internet of Things.
