_Business Spotlight brings into focus highly innovative companies in the home automation space and deep dives into what makes these companies tick. We’ll explore the technologies they use, the challenges they face and often successfully solve, and try to gain an insight into what it takes to build and execute a game changing product._

Meet Keen Home, the makers of the Smart Vent system. Founded in the crucible of the NYC startup scene, they believe that imbibing important home systems like HVAC with intelligence can go a long way in realizing the goal of connected devices that actually do something useful. The Smart Vents, typically 10 of which are installed in the average home, communicate to each other, the user and the cloud to optimize comfort and increase power savings. As you&#8217;d expect, there&#8217;s a lot of engineering that goes on behind the scenes to build a product like this, so let&#8217;s get to it.

_Note: The author would like to thank Will MacCleod and Nate of Keen Home for being generous with his time and knowledge_

Motivation

Keen Home was an up and coming start up

Keen Home was started by a group of folks&#8230;.

?? New York startup scene is really good for IoT

Why the Smart Vent?

<div>
  Will sees Keen Home as a brand which represents core functions of the home. Keen Home believe that there&#8217;s a lot to be gained by focussing on the bigger utilities in the house like electrical, plumbing or HVAC, which are chores right now and building devices and systems that eliminate the chores. [ mention nest? ]

  There’s a great opportunity for companies to take another look at IoT, it is ‘hot’ &#8211; lot of companies are saying let’s connect we have, things like microwaves and what not. What really works about the vent though, and get our whole team motivated, and is something that will help us identify future products, is that Keen Home as a brand is about core functions of the home. Things like utilities that have a job to do, electrical or plumbing or HVAC &#8211; things that are built into the house, are just chores right now. So for example if you have a HVAC system, you can turn it on and off, and if you have a thermostat, you can set it. What NEST did to the thermostat was to bring intelligence to it, which in essence freed up the chore of programing your thermostat and made interacting with it a delightful experience. I think there’s a lot of room to do that with these other bigger utilities of the house.

  ‘Pro active devices’ &#8211; sophisticated, things that actually do something. Not just collecting and displaying data around the house, but doing something that results in a change that the user sees. We’re looking for things that eliminate chores.

Biggest Challenges

<div>
  Will says that one of Keen Home&#8217;s biggest ongoing technical challenges is that of maximizing battery life. Since battery replacements are not inexpensive to the user, extending battery life to a scale of years was a key feature of the Smart Vent from the start. As it so happened, in the course of doing so, Keen Home found that almost every aspect of the product was affected &#8211; from the user interface, to the hardware, the software, the plastics and metals used and parts sourced.

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Maximizing battery life at first looked to Keen Home like it would primarily be a hardware challenge &#8211; mainly a matter of optimizing the electronics and firmware to minimize power consumption. As they went on however, they started to realize how
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <b>Could you elaborate on how working on the battery life touched something like the user interface?</b>
</div>

<div>
  <b> </b>
</div>

<div>
  So when we sought to maximize batter life, our first thought was ok, we should look at hardware, for example get an efficient motor, handle all our electronics efficiently, ensure that the firmware operates efficiently, but being a product designer &#8211; you tend to think not only of hardware and software but also how the user will interact with the device. IF the user interacts with the device such that they’re constantly fiddling with it, opening/closing, on/off … if the user needs to know something about the vent like what temperature a room, or what pressure state is all at different times, then we have constantly poll the firmware, so understanding how different control paradigms affect the user interface.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  IoT presents us with a new challenge in the sense that really the user interface and experience is what should be leading the project. Cos the user is the ONLY thing that unites hardware, software, fronted, backend, firmware, manufacturing. When you ask yourself let’s say in manufacturing, what kind of spring should I be using, you have to think, ‘what does that affect?’. It might affect what the user sees, but it does end up affecting what the user experiences. Things like battery life, for example. If the spring I choose has a higher resistance that means I have to make a tradeoff. For example I can’t sample temperature as often and does that matter? It matters to the user experience, because if the information is a few seconds behind, then the user experience designer as a project lead needs to know whether that’s acceptable. It’s almost like a new paradigm.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Spring itself is electrical impedance which affects battery life. But there’s more to that &#8211; mechanically a spring might be more conductive, have more spring force. Springs are what unload the battery, they eject them for you. So that whole set of controls meant that to change the spring we had to have a conversation between electrical, mechanical, product, user experience and even software. So we have to be able to think multidimensionally as an organization and have these kinds of meetings on a regular basis.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It’s a heavy challenge to the organization because it requires a lot of cross functional collaboration, having the right size of team certainly helps. It’s about making sure everyone has the same values, that they understand no matter what area they’re in what the end goal is. When we hire people, even engineers (who typically don’t have to worry about product design), we look for people who have an appreciation for the design process and aesthetics. and it’s paid dividends because our team communication is really good. but it’s even practical things lile project management tools that engineers use   … ?
