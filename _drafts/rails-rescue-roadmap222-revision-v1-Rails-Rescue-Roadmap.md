## Has your Rails application gone off the rails, dragging your business along with it?

**Does this sound familiar? **

You need to build new features to grow and improve your business, but you’re noticing that the time taken to develop them has been gradually increasing. This causes missed deadlines and frustration amongst your team.

Not only that, when a new feature does get built, it causes other parts of your app to break and leaves your team in a scramble to deploy non-optimal hot fixes so your users and clients are not affected.

Hot fixes, which once deployed, are never refactored and cleaned up. Which unfortunately leaves your codebase more fragile, and harder (read &#8220;more expensive”) to work on than before.

Your team is too busy putting out fires to spend time on professional growth and &#8220;important but not urgent” things like documentation, gem updates and refactoring. This not only further degrades the quality and security of your codebase, but leads to your developers seeking a better work environment elsewhere (in fact, you might already have had this dreaded conversation with one or more of your developers).

Although getting your app out to your users as soon as possible has been and remains a top priority, you now realize that to incur technical debt while doing so is not a smart thing to do &#8212; especially because you are playing the long game when it comes to the growth and success of your business.

Your Rails app needs to stop getting in the way of your business goals and back to helping you achieve them.

It’s time to find a way out of the mess your codebase is in and get it to a place where it is a pleasure to work on. It&#8217;s high time to ensure that this situation will never repeat itself.

Here’s how I can help&#8230;

**Get a ready-to-use roadmap for exactly how to rescue your ailing Rails application**

A Rails Rescue Roadmap is a clear path which will identify, via a step-by-step process, exactly what you need to do to rescue your Rails application. It will start off by determining the current health of your application and what it does well. Then, it will go on to diagnose the problems your application has and outline a set of strategies, techniques and tactics that you can use to fix these problems for the long term.

Your Roadmap will be unique to you and your business, and be tailored to your unique development process.

**Here’s how we’ll work together to put together your Rails Rescue Roadmap&#8230;**

First, I’ll send you a short questionnaire designed to highlight the problems you’re having, and the goals you have for your business and codebase.

Once I receive your answers, we’ll block out 1 to 3 hours to discuss your development process and application in detail. I will probably send you some follow-up questions after that to drill deeper.

When I have what I need, I’ll begin a step-by-step process which will cover the following areas:

  * Codebase Audit, including a detailed audit of the top three problem areas. This could include performance, security, object oriented design and other areas.
  * Infrastructure and Process Audit, with the goal of determining if you’re up to date with best practices. More importantly, my goal is to determine if the choices you&#8217;ve made are working for or against you.
  * Recommendations

Along with the results of the audit, you’ll get:

  * Action items your team can immediately put to work to incrementally improve the quality of your application
  * A six month roadmap spelling out what you need to do to rescue your Rails application

Finally, I’ll make myself available to discuss next steps.
