Hi there,

This is part two of five of the Rails Testing and Technical Debt course you signed up for. Last time we discussed the importance of having tests before making a change to your codebase and how you can introduce tests to untested code in your app. By now, you should have an idea of where the inflection points in your code are. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about how we can introduce tests to these inflection points.

Now that you&#8217;ve had a brief intro to authentication and the parts that comprise it, next time we&#8217;re going to talk about authorization.

All the best,

-Ali

P.S. Have any questions about authentication or Rails security in general? Let me know in a reply to this email and I&#8217;ll follow up as quickly as I can. Looking forward to hearing from you.
