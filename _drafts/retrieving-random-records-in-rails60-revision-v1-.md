  The first priority that you likely have to keep in mind is speed. Most applications have a threshold for what is considered slow &#8211; in web apps for example, anything that takes longer than a few hundred milliseconds to load is considered slow. So you don&#8217;t want to be choosing a method that will have your users waiting around forever for your app to do something. That being said, there is also no point in sacrificing code readability, ease of re-use and just time in general, to get faster than you have to.

  end

  def state_id_name
    "#{location_state_abbr}-#{id}-#{name}"

    return location_name if location_type == 'State'
    location.state.name
