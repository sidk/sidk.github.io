[ILLUSTRATION IDEA: gnarly cartoon knot with CSRF, CORS, XSS, CSP, Javascript, Ajax, XHR, cookies, local storage etc]

You're probably aware of the fact that when you make a request from your front-end to your server, the browser can automatically send along any cookies associated to your server's domain with that request. You perhaps also know that you can set CORS headers to bypass the browser's same-origin policy and let your front-end talk to servers which have a different origin from the front-end.

In addition, you might believe that setting a CORS policy ensures that the browser will not automatically send cookies to your server if the request was coming from an origin not specified in the CORS policy. A malicious website open in another browser tab, for instance (aka a CSRF attack). This is, unfortunately, not entirely true.

> "I still am fairly sure that the browser will not send the cookie just because the request is being made to the proper domain. The browser knows the origin the script came from and uses THAT origin to compare with CORS. If I make a website, and the browser is respecting CORS, then there is no way to gain access to cookies from another domain"

Keeping our users safe as they use our apps is, of course, super important. However, because browsers are highly complex, it can be rather easy to develop an incomplete understanding of the browser security model and make reasoning errors that put our users at risk.

As far as a browser is concerned, "requests" are not all created equal. Are you referring to `fetch` or `XMLHTTPRequest`? A regular old form submit with a `POST`, perhaps? Or just a plain URL link that translates to a `GET`? What kind of content type does your server accept? The browser behaves slightly differently for each one of these cases, and while correctly setting a CORS policy may protect your users from a subset of them, you can't be sure that your users will be protected against CSRF until you develop a more holistic understanding of the browser security model.

## Browsers are amazing

Browsers are wonderful pieces of software. They give us web app developers a platform to let our imaginations and creativity run wild. Over the years, they have also evolved a multitude of ways to protect our apps' users from harm. This is great, because not only can we build an almost endless variety of apps, we can also rely on the browser to do a substantial amount of work in keeping our users safe.

However, you don't have be an expert in browser software to realize that this duality - being flexible enough to support a large variety of apps _and_ being restrictive enough to protect users from harm - means that browsers often have to tread a fine line between the two concepts. What this implies in practice is that **it falls to us developers to evaluate tradeoffs, _make decisions_ on where to draw the line, and most importantly, figure out if we need to do any _extra_ work to keep our users safe** [reword the bolded statement to be clearer?]

## So, do browsers keep cookies hidden from other domains or not?

It depends. Take a look at the flowchart below, developed by [Alex Lauerman at Trust Foundry](https://trustfoundry.net/cross-site-request-forgery-cheat-sheet/).

![Trust Foundry CSRF Cheat Sheet](/assets/images/CSRF-CheatSheet-v2.2-3.png)

- The light green "terminal" boxes (where the flowchart ends) indicate scenarios where CSRF is likely. In these scenarios, an attacker can use the user's cookies and thus have "access" to them.
- The pathways leading to the red terminal box (the one which says "CSRF not possible") are worth paying attention to because they tell us how we can prevent CSRF attacks from occuring. In these scenarios, an attacker will not be able to use the user's cookies to carry out an attack.
- A CORS policy, when set, cannot protect your users from CSRF any more than the [same origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) can. In some cases, when set unoptimally, it can potentially increase the likelihood of a CSRF attack.
- The most reliable way to keep CSRF at bay is to use a cryptographically random anti-CSRF token.
- Though the flowchart doesn't mention it, setting the `SameSite` flag on your cookies will go a step further to protect your users against CSRF.

<small>Note: This flowchart, and the associated article, was published in 2014, which means some of the information may be out of date by virtue of browsers having evolved newer security measures. I don't think this matters for our purposes though.</small>

CSRF is possible precisely because an attacker is able to use your user's cookies for their benefit, by exploiting edge cases in the intersection of browser behaviour and the specific security configuration choices you've made.

## Check if your app is vulnerable to CSRF with this free tool!

This tool is a small step you can take on your journey to develop a holistic understanding of browser security. The aim of it is to teach. Try it on everything you can get your hands on - toy apps, work apps, local environments, deployed environments, your router's admin page etc. Basically, anything that can be opened up in a browser. If you can, also try it on different browsers to investigate if there are any differences in behaviour.

### Instructions

- Open your app in another browser tab and log in.
- Ensure you have running access to your app server logs. We'll be
- Enter in the URL of the endpoint you want to test (example: `http://localhost:3000/account/12/update`). You want to choose an endpoint that requires that user be logged in.
- Select the HTTP Method that your endpoint expects
- Data: The tool currently does not care about populating data for the endpoint, because it's only purpose is to see if an authenticated request can be made to your app. Once you verify that this is possible, it should be simple enough to figure out how to send the correct data to it. Click here to [copy some code to your clipboard] and experiment with sending data.
- Click 'Attack!'
- Now the important bit: Check your server logs. The tool will attempt to make a variety of requests to the endpoint you specified. If you're vulnerable to CSRF, you will

# MAYBE USE, MAYBE DELETE

On the other hand, precisely because browsers are so flexible, they also give attackers a platform to let _their_ imaginations and creativity run wild. To counter this, browser developers have over the years, been evolving various security features. The [same origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) was introduced by Netscape Navigator back in 1995 when Javascript was introduced. As the internet grew and web apps got more complicated, this was felt as being too restrictive and various workarounds existed to get around this, which both developers and attackers used. In 2005, [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) was adopted.

Point I'm trying to make: The internet has grown and continues to grow. The number of "use-cases" for the internet also continues to grow, which makes the types of apps we build diverse. Simultaneously, the threat landscape has also grown, along with the diversity of attacks (which you can think as just apps with a malicious purpose). In response to both forces, browsers have, in parallel, become more flexible and more protective. Because these two things are often mutually exclusive (for example, flexibility is often gained by sacrificing some security and vice versa), it falls to us developers to evaluate tradeoffs and _make decisions_ on where to draw the line.

## Browsers are as _complex_ as they are amazing

Now, the browser security model is _complicated_. This isn't surprising, because the browser itself is [seriously complicated](https://www.quora.com/How-many-lines-of-code-is-Google-Chrome). Think about it, on a typical browser, you can play games, conduct business, watch videos, listen to music, share files, learn new things...the list is endless. And you can do all these things concurrently! ðŸ˜‚

[ILLUSTRATION IDEA: the matrix, with some kind of indication that its a browser]

Because the browser security model is so complex, its easy to make missteps in your reasoning about how secure your app is. You of course don't want to do this because you care about your users' safety.
